# Delivery Management System
The Delivery Management System is an advanced software solution designed to optimize the logistics of truck deliveries. It employs a suite of sophisticated algorithms to determine the most efficient and fastest route to the destination, ensuring timely and cost-effective deliveries.

## Key Features
Algorithm-Driven Routing
The core functionality of this system lies in its ability to process multiple algorithms, selecting the optimal path for the truck based on various factors such as distance, traffic conditions, and delivery urgency.

### Comprehensive Software Testing
#### Unit Testing: Rigorous unit tests were implemented to validate individual components of the system, ensuring each module performs as expected in isolation.
#### Blackbox Testing: Extensive blackbox testing was conducted to assess the system's functionality without delving into its internal code structure. This ensured that the system meets the specified requirements from an end-user perspective.
#### Whitebox Testing: In parallel, whitebox testing was employed to examine the internal workings of the application. This approach allowed us to verify the accuracy of the algorithms and the logical flow of data within the system.</br>
### Agile Methodology
#### Scrum Reports: We adopted an agile development process, with regular Scrum reports documenting progress, challenges, and iterations. This ensured a transparent and adaptive workflow.
#### Jira Kanban: Project management was facilitated through Jira Kanban boards, enabling efficient tracking of tasks, sprint planning, and issue resolution.
Client-Centric Development
All business requirements provided by the client were meticulously fulfilled, with a strong focus on delivering a robust and reliable system that meets the operational needs of modern logistics.

### Conclusion
This project is not just about route optimization; it showcases a holistic approach to software development with a heavy emphasis on testing and quality assurance. The combination of agile practices, thorough testing, and algorithmic efficiency makes this delivery management system a powerful tool in the logistics industry.
